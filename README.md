# Java Sudoku Game
_Note - This is a just dev sandbox project used for learning new technologies. 
        Not intended to for public use._

This is a project to create an Sudoku game in Java with a GUI using Swing. 

### To run the command line project: 
Navigate to directory `SudokuApp/src/com/mycompany/sudoku`
1. Compile:
```
javac Main.java
```
2. Run: 
```
java Main.java
```

### To run the GUI:
Navigate to directory `SudokuApp/src/com/mycompany/sudoku`
1. Compile:
```
javac SudokuGUI.java
```
2. Run: 
```
java SudokuGUI.java
```
### _TODO:_
1. research backtracking and randomizer issues
2. extract methods/board to classes
3. create UI using Swing
4. add test coverage
5. Potential future feature - puzzle solver logic (upload puzzle to solve)?
