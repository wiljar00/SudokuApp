_Note - This is a just dev sandbox project used for learning new technologies. 
        Not intended to for public use._

This is a project to create an Sudoku game in Java with a GUI using Swing. 


### _TODO:_
1. research backtracking and randomizer issues
2. extract methods/board to classes
3. create UI using Swing
4. add test coverage
5. Potential future feature - puzzle solver logic (upload puzzle to solve)?
